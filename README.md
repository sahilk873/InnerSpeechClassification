Inner Speech Classification Project
This project focuses on classifying inner speech using advanced machine learning models. By leveraging Transformer Neural Networks (TNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), we aim to capture the temporal dynamics and high-dimensional structure of inner speech data for effective classification.
